# PEFT adapter methods to compare (Used by experiment runners)
methods:
  - lora    # Standard LoRA
  - loha    # Low-rank Hadamard Product
  - lokr    # Low-rank Kronecker Product
  - vera    # Very Efficient Rank Adaptation
  - fourierft # Fourier Feature Transform
  - adalora # Adaptive LoRA
  - waveft  # Wavelet Feature Transform

# Mapping of concept names to class names (for evaluation prompts)
# If a concept is not in this mapping, the concept name itself will be used

# --- Removed Redundant Training Config Section --- #
# Training parameters like max_train_steps, learning_rate, train_batch_size, 
# gradient_accumulation_steps, seed (for training), use_8bit_adam, 
# instance_data_dir, instance_prompt, class_name, save_steps, validation_steps, 
# validation_prompt, num_validation_images should be defined in the dedicated
# training_config.yaml file.
# pretrained_model_name_or_path used for training is also defined there.
